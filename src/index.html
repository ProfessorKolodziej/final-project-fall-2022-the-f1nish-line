					<p>Since its inaugural race in 1950, Formula 1 has become the pinnacle of international motorsport
						competition.
						But why the name "Formula 1"? Well, it's more than just a number – it represents a set of meticulously
						crafted rules and regulations that all participants must follow. The term "formula" embodies these
						guidelines, while the number 'one' stands as a symbol of the highest level of racing on the global
						stage.
						The Formula One World Championship takes us on an exhilarating journey from March to December,
						spanning 21
						races in 21 different countries across four continents. Get ready to dive into the world of speed,
						technology, and the pursuit of excellence as we explore the captivating universe of Formula 1.</p>

					<h2>The Teams</h2>
					<p>There are ten teams that participate in the Formula 1 World Championship every year. Each team is
						called a
						‘constructor’. Teams receive points based on their drivers’ performance in each race. These points
						determine
						the team’s ranking as they compete for the annual Constructors’ Championship within the Formula 1
						World
						Championship.</p>

					<h2>The Grand Prix</h2>
					<p>The heart of Formula 1 racing beats to the rhythm of Grand Prix weekends, a three-day spectacle
						from
						Friday
						to Sunday that ignites the passion of fans around the world. The racing events that occur at each
						Formula 1
						track are collectively called a Grand Prix.</p>
					<h3>Free Practice</h3>
					<section class="gp-fp">
						<img src="images/GP FP.jpg" class="img-gp-fp">
						<p>The Grand Prix journey kicks off on a Friday, featuring two adrenaline-fueled one-hour practice
							sessions
							known as Free Practice 1 (FP1) and Free Practice 2 (FP2). It's here that drivers get their first
							taste
							of
							the race track, honing their skills and fine-tuning their cars. As the day progresses, they push
							their
							machines to the limit, gearing up for the challenges ahead.</p>
					</section>
					<h3>Sprint Race</h3>
					<section class="gp-sprint">
						<img src="images/GP Sprint.jpg" class="img-gp-sprint">
						<p>Occasionally, the Grand Prix weekend takes an exhilarating twist with the inclusion of Sprint
							races.
							In
							2023, we're in for a treat with six Sprint weekends. The Sprint is a high-speed 100km dash,
							setting
							the grid
							order for the main event on Sunday. Sprint weekends follow a unique format, featuring practice,
							qualifying,
							the Sprint race, and, as always, the Grand Prix on Sunday. It's a weekend filled with non-stop
							action
							that
							keeps fans at the edge of their seats.</p>
					</section>
					<h3>Qualifying</h3>
					<section class="gp-quali">
						<img src="images/GP Quali.webp" class="img-gp-quali">
						<p>Saturday afternoon ushers in the intense battle of Qualifying, divided into three stages: Q1,
							Q2,
							and
							Q3,
							with each stage getting shorter and more competitive. The stakes are high, as the fastest
							drivers
							secure
							their positions at the front, known as pole position. For those who don't make the cut, it's a
							tough
							break,
							and they'll start the race from further back on the grid. Qualifying is the stage where teams
							and
							drivers
							showcase their speed, precision, and determination to win.</p>
					</section>
					<h3>The Race</h3>
					<section class="gp-race">
						<img src="images/GP Race.jpg" class="img-gp-race">
						<p>Sunday is the day we've all been waiting for, as the Grand Prix takes center stage. Before the
							race
							begins, drivers embark on reconnaissance laps to assess track conditions and make final
							preparations. They
							then line up on the grid according to their qualifying positions, and after the national anthem,
							it's time
							for the formation lap. Watch as drivers weave their cars, warming up their tires in anticipation
							of
							the
							Grand Prix's green light. As the race director initiates the start sequence, the five red lights
							illuminate,
							extinguishing one by one before the roar of engines fills the air. <br> <br>The race is on!
							Grands
							Prix
							typically
							last up to two hours or reach the minimum distance of laps that exceeds 305 kilometers. In 2023,
							points are
							awarded based on performance and the driver who crosses the finish line first wins the Grand
							Prix,
							with an extra point for the driver who records the fastest race lap within the top 10.</p>

					<h3>Tires</h3>
					<p>Understanding Tires in Formula 1 can get very overwhelming very fast however they are an intregal
						part
						of a
						team’s strategy throughout the weekend. Thus we hope to break it down a bit for everyone to
						understand
						this
						a bit better.</p>
					<h4>Weather-based Tires</h4>
					<section class="parts-tires-weather">
						<img src="images/Weather Based Tires.png" class="img-tires-weather">
						<p>To account for the weather variable Pirelli has created three different weather based tires. The
							first
							type
							and the most common one are the slick tires. These tires are the fastest thus often the tires
							drivers
							prefer. However they also have the least amount of grip thus not ideal for rainy weather. The
							following
							tires are the intermediates. These tires are used for exactly what their name tells them to be
							used
							for.
							They are ideal for light rain and are have an average amount of grip and speed. The last type of
							tires
							are
							wet tires which have the most grip but are the slowest. However sometimes they are needed to
							ensure
							the
							safety of the drivers.</p>
					</section>
					<h4>Tire Compounds</h4>
					<section class="parts-tires-compound">
						<img src="images/Tire Compounds.png" class="img-tires-compound">
						<p>In order to make the races more interesting Pirelli has 6 different compounds of tires for teams
							to
							choose
							between. Giving teams these options really adds pressure to them in ensuring they apply the best
							strategy
							throughout the weekend.
							Pirelli has divided the different compounds into three main categories soft, medium and hard.
							The
							soft
							tires
							are sleekest tires so they go the fastest but they also last the least amount of time which can
							mean
							the
							team has to add an extra pit stop causing their driver to loose time. The hard tires have the
							most
							rigids
							causing them to slow down but they also last longer often making them ideal for tracks with
							extremely
							high
							temperatures that can increase tire degradation. Lastly there are medium tires which again their
							name
							is
							very indicative as to what they do. These tires right in between in terms of duration and speed
							often
							being
							the main choice for drivers and teams.</p>
					</section>
					<h3>DRS</h3>
					<section class="parts-drs">
						<p>DRS is a racing component that has been introduced with modern racing. It was introduced as a
							way
							to
							help
							drivers race with each other and increase the amount of overtaking within each race.</p>
						<img src="images/DRS Tires.png" class="img-drs">
						<p>DRS or drag reduction system allows drivers open a flap within their rear wing to reduce the
							amount
							of
							drag
							within their car to increase their car’s speed and hopefully overtake the car in front of them.
							However this
							system can only be activated within specific sections of a track and only if the distance
							between
							their car
							and the car in front of them is one second or less.</p>
